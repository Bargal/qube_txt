Qube - a simple text game.

 Created at the beginning as a simple structural porogram, and then as you acquire knowledge
 transformed into an increasingly advanced object program.
 at https://github.com/Mighn/qube_txt/commits/master I put all the development of the code.
 I also use this program to learn the basic functionalities of Github.

Entry point is main() function inside main.cpp file

first stage (prototype) of this program is here: https://github.com/Mighn/qube_txt-prototype

At this moment I working on event system (enemy, ally, and chest) and next one will be key system: You can 
find a key while encouter, and use to open a single door 

I think, is to many code in main file, and will be nice move some of it to class metods.
